There are numbers of the finding that I got during the test. I choose to use Browser Screenshot functions to record my findings

Errors:
  1. Customer initialed number field should not allow anything other than numbers as input. Test case 4 and 5 failed as system took the input but ignore it. 
        - 1e2
        - 1E11
     so Capital E or small letter e in between numbers will not trigger the error notification to users "Kentt√§ on pakollinen."
     This is an error
